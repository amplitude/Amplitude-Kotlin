# Amplitude Unified SDK â€“ Android

The Amplitude Unified SDK for Android provides a single integration point for Amplitude analytics, experimentation, and session replay features in Android applications. This SDK is designed to streamline setup, ensure consistency across Amplitude's product suite, and support extensibility for future capabilities.

This repository is part of Amplitude's cross-platform Unified SDK initiative, alongside [Web](https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-TypeScript/tree/main/packages/unified) and [iOS](https://github.com/amplitude/AmplitudeUnified-Swift) implementations.

## Key Points

- Access analytics, experimentation, and session replay through a unified API.
- Reduce integration complexity and maintenance overhead.
- Enable remote configuration and feature toggling without additional engineering effort.
- Ensure consistent identity and session management across Amplitude features.
